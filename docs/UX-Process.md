# UX Research and Design Process
Double diamonds, skateboards, and squiggly lined activities better defined as our practiced User Experience Research and Design process. Here is how we are going to, "fight for the users".

## UX Strategy
The vision of the Terminus UX Design Practice is new, yet mature in directional drive. We believe in listening carefully, iterating quickly, and value constructive critique at all points of our process. As a work in progress, we will learn from our mistakes and strive to bring positive user/business findings into the product. As practitioners of UX Design in the B2B marketing space there will be many user + data driven experiments, plenty of exciting user + Terminus team collaboration, and the results will always bring about better relationships and a more refined product.

An upcoming 2018-2019 UX Strategy will be produced soon.

## Workflow
> "The state of our economy calls for action, bold and swift."
[President Barack Obama: Inaugural Address](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2009/01/21/president-barack-obamas-inaugural-address)

As a UX Practice, we must be swift and bold with our actions. This means lean research, lean UX assets, lean documentation, and lean pushes to production.

1. Discovery by-any-means-necessary (with users, customer advisory board, CSM team, internal experts, etc.)
2. Low fidelity iteration (whiteboards, sticky notes, napkin sketches, maybe Balsamiq for a quick prototype)
3. Share with team
4. Refine and repeat number 3 until a high level of confidence is achieved
4. Work with Product to write up a feature ticket

Refine and move to high fidelity wireframes ONLY if needed for marketing purposes.

### UX Kanban Defined

| **Phase** | **Lead** | **Advisors + Followers** |
|------------|---------|----------------------|
| **Definition** | Product | UX, Engineering, CSM |
| **Design** | UX | Product, Engineering, CSM |
| **User Validation / User Testing** | UX | Product, CSM, Engineering |

| Ready to Ship | Product | Engineering, QA |
| Shipped | Engineering | Product |
| **Validation** | UX | Product, Engineering, CSM |

### UX Practice Assets
Before we utilize any graphic assets, we must listen, draw, share, and repeat. Low fidelity iteration is where we start!

1. Master Sketch File - Currently shared internally with team through GetAbstract. Sign up at [GetAbstract](https://www.goabstract.com/)

2. Master Graphic Asset Folder (icons, colors, fonts, oh my!)
