# UX Design Practice Guide
Design goodies.

## About this Guide
This is where all the Terminus UX Design Practice assets, processes, and goodies will live. More awesome things to come!

As a growing UX Team, we are doing our best to document the process so that those interested in working with Terminus have an enjoyable recruiting / prospecting experience. Since this is a work in progress, please understand that steps might be added, changed, removed from our process at any time. We will keep this as updated as possible. Read about our current [our recruiting process](UX-recruiting.md).

### Guide Goals
1. A central repository for living design related stuffs.
2. A collaborative environment that allows for open contribution, fast changes, discussions, and efficiency through consistency.
3. A place where both sandbox (iterative) and product level artifacts can live.

## UX Strategy
The vision of the Terminus UX Design Practice is new, yet mature in directional drive. We believe in listening carefully, iterating quickly, and value constructive critique at all points of our process. As a work in progress, we will learn from our mistakes and strive to bring positive user/business findings into the product. As practitioners of UX Design in the B2B marketing space there will be many user + data driven experiments, plenty of exciting user + Terminus team collaboration, and the results will always bring about better relationships and a more refined product.

An upcoming 2017-2018 UX Strategy will be produced soon.

1. Discovery by-any-means-necessary (with users, customer advisory board, CSM team, internal experts, etc.)
2. Low fidelity iteration (whiteboards, sticky notes, napkin sketches, maybe Balsamiq for a quick prototype)
3. Share with team
4. Refine and repeat number 3 until a high level of confidence is achieved
4. Work with Product to write up a feature ticket

Refine and move to high fidelity wireframes ONLY if needed for marketing purposes. Engineering team does not need high fidelity wireframes in order to

### UX Practice Assets
Before we utilize any graphic assets, we must listen, draw, share, and repeat. Low fidelity iteration is where we start! When it comes time to make a visual composition of a thought out concept, all of our digital
