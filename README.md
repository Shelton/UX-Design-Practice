# UX Design Practice Guide
Design goodies.

## About this Guide
This is where all the Terminus UX Design Practice assets, processes, and goodies will live. More awesome things to come!

As a growing UX Team, we are doing our best to document the process so that those interested in working with Terminus have an enjoyable recruiting / prospecting experience. Since this is a work in progress, please understand that steps might be added, changed, removed from our process at any time. We will keep this as updated as possible.

### Guide Goals
1. A central repository for living design related stuffs.
2. A collaborative environment that allows for open contribution, fast changes, discussions, and efficiency through consistency.
3. A place where both sandbox (iterative) and product level artifacts can live.

## Current Resources:
1. [Recruiting Process](docs/UX-Recruiting.md)
2. [Onboarding Zebras](docs/UX-Onboarding-Mentoring.md).
3. [UI Design Library](https://github.com/GetTerminus/terminus-ui)

Cheers!
